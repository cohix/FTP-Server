A simple program where messages are exchanged between
the client and the server.

For all intents and purposes the client code given here is not to be used at the moment. Other members of the group are creating a client in android in a different repository. client.c only exists here as a carry over file from a previous project used as a template that will likely become functional at some point. At the moment though it is not used.
